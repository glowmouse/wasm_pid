# PID Simulator

A PID Simulator written in Web Assembly.

The goal of this project is to help students with a high school math 
background (specifically students competing in First Robotics) understand 
PID controllers.  Many of the descriptions of how PID controllers work
(example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) assume
math background that isn't until the senior years of high school.

The project was inspired by the PID tutorial in this video:
